    <h3>Meiji Era</h3>
    <p>The Meiji Era in Japan, which lasted from 1868 to 1912, was a transformative period marked by rapid modernization and westernization. It began when Emperor Meiji was restored to power, ending centuries of feudal rule under the Tokugawa shogunate. Determined to strengthen the country and avoid colonization by Western powers, Japan adopted Western political, military, industrial, and educational systems. The government abolished the samurai class, built a modern army and navy, and introduced compulsory education and new infrastructure such as railways and telegraphs. This era also saw the rise of factories, a constitution, and elected legislature. By the end of the Meiji Era, Japan had emerged as a modern industrial nation and a growing imperial power, significantly altering its place in the world.</p>

    <h3>Heisei Era</h3>
    <p>The Heisei Era in Japan spanned from 1989 to 2019, during the reign of Emperor Akihito, and was a period of significant change and challenge for the country. It began with the burst of Japan’s economic bubble, leading to a prolonged recession known as the “Lost Decade,” which deeply impacted the nation’s economy and social outlook. Despite these economic struggles, the Heisei Era was marked by technological advancement, cultural globalization, and efforts to address issues such as an aging population and environmental sustainability. Japan faced several major natural disasters during this time, most notably the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, which triggered the Fukushima nuclear crisis. In response, the era saw a strengthening of community resilience and international cooperation. The Heisei Era ended in 2019 when Emperor Akihito abdicated—the first emperor to do so in over two centuries—passing the throne to his son, Naruhito, and ushering in the Reiwa Era.</p>

    <h3>Jomon Period</h3>
    <p>The Jōmon Period, which lasted from around 14,000 BCE to 300 BCE, is the earliest known era of Japanese history and is named after the distinctive “cord-marked” pottery created during this time. The people of the Jōmon period were primarily hunter-gatherers, relying on fishing, hunting, and foraging, but they also practiced early forms of agriculture and lived in semi-permanent pit dwellings. Their pottery, among the oldest in the world, was often decorated with intricate patterns made by pressing cords into the clay. The Jōmon people also created clay figurines known as *dogū*, believed to have spiritual or ritual significance. This period reflects a rich and complex prehistoric culture with deep connections to nature, spirituality, and community life, laying the foundation for later Japanese civilization.

    <h3>Edo Period</h3>
    <p>The Edo Period, which lasted from 1603 to 1868, was a time of relative peace, stability, and isolation under the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate. Centered in Edo (modern-day Tokyo), this era saw the strict enforcement of a social hierarchy, with samurai, farmers, artisans, and merchants occupying distinct classes. The shogunate maintained control through a policy of national seclusion (*sakoku*), limiting foreign influence and trade to only a few ports. Despite this isolation, culture flourished during the Edo Period, with the rise of Kabuki theater, woodblock printing (*ukiyo-e*), and popular literature. Urban centers grew, and merchant culture began to thrive, gradually shifting the balance of power in society. The Edo Period came to an end when external pressure, especially from Western powers, forced Japan to open its borders, leading to the collapse of the shogunate and the beginning of the Meiji Restoration.</p>
