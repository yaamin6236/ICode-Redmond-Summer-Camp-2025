    <h3>Cuisine</h3>
    <p>Japan's cuisine is renowned for its emphasis on fresh, seasonal ingredients, meticulous presentation, and balanced flavors. Traditional dishes like sushi, sashimi, tempura, and miso soup highlight the natural taste of ingredients, often accompanied by rice and pickled vegetables. Regional specialties and street foods, such as takoyaki and okonomiyaki, add variety and local flavor to Japanese dining. Meals often reflect the season, with spring dishes featuring ingredients like bamboo shoots and cherry blossoms, while autumn brings mushrooms and chestnuts. Whether served in a humble ramen shop or an elegant kaiseki meal, Japanese cuisine celebrates simplicity, harmony, and respect for nature.</p>

    <h3>Clothing</h3>
    <p>Japan’s traditional clothing reflects its rich cultural heritage, with the kimono being the most iconic garment. Worn by both men and women, the kimono is a long, robe-like garment wrapped around the body and secured with a wide sash called an obi. Kimonos are made from fine fabrics like silk and often feature intricate patterns that reflect the seasons, nature, or cultural symbols. Other traditional garments include the yukata, a lighter, casual version of the kimono worn in summer or at festivals, and the hakama, wide-legged pants often worn over a kimono for formal occasions or martial arts. Though now mostly worn for ceremonies, festivals, and special events, traditional clothing remains a proud symbol of Japanese identity and artistry.</p>

    <h3>Mythology</h3>
    <p>Japan’s mythology is rich and deeply connected to its ancient Shinto beliefs, featuring a pantheon of gods Kami, creation stories, and legendary heroes. At the heart of Japanese mythology is the story of the sun goddess Amaterasu, one of the most revered deities, believed to be the ancestor of the imperial family. According to myth, Japan was created by the divine siblings Izanagi and Izanami, who formed the islands and gave birth to many gods. These stories are collected in ancient texts like the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, which blend myth with early history. Mythological creatures such as Tengu, Oni, and Yokai also play a significant role in folklore, shaping Japan’s cultural imagination through art, literature, and traditional festivals.</p>
