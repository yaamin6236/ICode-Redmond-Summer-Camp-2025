    <h2>Uses for the Chip</h2>
    <p>Neuralink can:</p>
    <ol type="A">
    <li>Bring back abilities to otherwise diabled patients,</li>
    <li>Control other devices and computers,</li>
    <li style="text-align:center;">and Turn you into an alien</li>
    </ol> 
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 24px">In the future, Neuralink may be used to enhance memory, correct neurological diseases, and help with damaged spinal cords.</p>
