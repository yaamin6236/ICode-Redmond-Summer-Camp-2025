        <h2 style="text-align: center;">#5: The Space Needle</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The Space Needle is located in Seattle, Washington. It stands at 605 feet(184 meters). Known for the awe-inspiring Legacy Light, a bright beam of light that is projected into the sky on special occasions. You get breathtaking 360-degree views of Seattle’s skyline, Puget Sound, mountains like Mount Rainier, and on clear days, you can see for miles. It’s a landmark piece of mid-century modern design and a symbol of futuristic thinking from the 1960s. The deck slowly rotates, so you can enjoy different views without moving around too much. The Space Needle has a revolving restaurant where you can eat while taking in those incredible sights (though it’s good to book ahead). If you love photography, it’s a dream spot to capture the city from above, especially during sunrise, sunset, or at night when the city lights up. Visiting connects you to Seattle’s history and the 1962 World’s Fair, which was a big deal in the city’s development. It’s located in Seattle Center, close to other cool places like the Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP), Chihuly Garden and Glass, and the Pacific Science Center. They often host events, light shows, or themed experiences that make a visit even more exciting.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">#4: The Hollywood Sign</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The Hollywood sign is one of the most important landmarks to visit when in th U.S. Located in Los Angeles, California, it is likely the most well-known landmark in all of California. The sign itself makes for an epic backdrop for photos. You can capture it from several spots with stunning views of Los Angeles. The trails leading up to the sign through Griffith Park offer a fun, active way to explore LA’s nature and get some exercise. The hikes range from easy to moderate. Besides the sign, you get panoramic views of the city and on clear days, even the ocean and mountains. Standing near the sign connects you to Hollywood’s rich history and all the movies and stars that have made the area legendary. After or before visiting the sign, you can check out Griffith Observatory, another iconic LA spot with amazing views and cool exhibits. Unlike some tourist attractions, you can get up close (without actually touching the sign) and feel the vibe of the Hollywood hills.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">#3: The Statue of Liberty</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> The Statue of Liberty is over a century old, located in New York Harbor, New York. It is 305 feet tall. The Statue of Liberty is a universal symbol of freedom and one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world. It was a gift from France in 1886 and represents hope, liberty, and the American Dream. It’s on nearly every travel bucket list. Seeing it in person — whether from a ferry or the pedestal — is a truly memorable experience. The museum on Liberty Island offers fascinating exhibits about immigration, the statue’s construction, and its significance throughout history. The ferry ride to Liberty Island offers beautiful views of the NYC skyline, Ellis Island, and the harbor — a relaxing bonus experience. Millions of immigrants passed through nearby Ellis Island, and for many, the statue was the first symbol of hope they saw in America.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">#2: The White House</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> The White House is the home of presidents, located in Washington DC. Every U.S. president since John Adams has lived there. Touring it connects you to over 200 years of U.S. history, major decisions, and iconic events. From the neoclassical exterior to the historic rooms like the East Room, Blue Room, and State Dining Room, the White House is beautifully preserved and rich in detail. Visiting the White House gives a firsthand look at the inner workings of the U.S. government and the daily life of a president. It’s a living history lesson. Even if you don't get a tour, viewing the White House from Lafayette Square or The Ellipse gives you iconic photo ops and a real sense of its presence. It’s located in the heart of Washington, D.C., close to the National Mall, Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, and world-class Smithsonian Museums. White House tours are free, but must be requested through a Member of Congress (or your country’s embassy if you're visiting internationally). Getting in is exclusive and memorable.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">#1: The Empire State Building</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> The Empire State building is the tallest building in the U.S, standing at 1,454 feet tall, located in New York. It’s one of the most famous skyscrapers in the world and a symbol of New York City’s skyline and ambition. You get jaw-dropping 360-degree views of Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Statue of Liberty, and beyond from the 86th and 102nd-floor observation decks. Seeing NYC lit up at night from the Empire State Building is absolutely magical—one of the best cityscape views you can get. Built in 1931, it was the tallest building in the world for decades and remains a marvel of Art Deco design and engineering. Featured in countless movies and TV shows (hello, King Kong!), it’s a piece of cinematic history as well. Whether sunrise, sunset, or nighttime, the views and lighting make for incredible photos. Right in Midtown Manhattan, it’s easy to combine with visits to Times Square, Bryant Park, or the New York Public Library. The building has interesting exhibits about its construction, history, and role in the city’s development.</p>
