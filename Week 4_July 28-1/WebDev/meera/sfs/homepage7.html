    <h2>The Start</h2>
    <p>This website will have things, mostly my life stories, posted in many forms of communication in a few languages. Apart from those, there will also be books for viewing and reading, quizzes for your knowledge on me, and other fun stuff too. Come back every week for updates if you're interested in how the creator's life works. Chao!</p>

    <h2>Whoami?</h2>
    <p>I'm MM, the kid who created this website(for security, I'll not reveal my identity). I started creating this when I was 11 years old, and I've liked this ever since, though it's a lot of work putting it together. HYHFE!(Like this one, you may see code quite a bit in a few places).</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm 40% Indian and 60% European. You may think I'm ordinary but actually, I'm an alien, tomboy, and girly. Aliens are kids who don't <i>really</i> know who they are, tomboys are girls who do many stuff that other people think are more prone for boys, and girly people are ones who act like girls. I'll admit that I'm not much of this thingie.</p>

    <h2>Why I chose to create this website</h2>
    <p>I chose to create this website because I feel that creating websites are one of the ways that I can express myself. I love to share a bunch of stories and other stuff, so to do that, I created this website so other people can see who I am.</p>

    <h2>My hobbies</h2>
    <p>Here are my top hobbies: </p>
    <p style:"background-color:red;">Working on math problems, spying, learning new languages, having fun with my friends, and exercising, and gaming.</p>

    <h2>Come back for more updates in a while!</h2>
