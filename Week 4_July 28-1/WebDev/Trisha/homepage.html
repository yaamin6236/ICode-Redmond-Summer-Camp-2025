   <h3> Materials</h3>
<p style = "color:rgb(229, 32, 147);> The materials you will need are hooks macthing with the yarn size. So if there was a size 4.5mm the yarn should also be 4.5mm in thickness. You will see this on the side of the piece of paper going over the yarn. You will also need stuffing for some projects. Yarn needles and stich markers are necessary. It is also good to have scissors to cut the yarn. Somtimes you will need project based materials like buttons or a tape measure. For making earrings you will need earring hooks.</p>

   <h3>Stiches</h3>
<p style = "color:rgb(229, 32, 147);> They are many stiches such as a single crochet when you go into a stich and pull up a loop then yarn over and go through both loops. A double crochet is yarning over once and going into the stich, then pull up a loop and pull through 2, pull through 2. For a triple crochet you yarn over twice, pull up a loop from the stich and pull through 2, pull through 2, pull through 2. Chains are made by having a slip knot, yarning over and pulling through. Slip stiches go into a stich, pull up a loop and take that loop through the other loop. Half double crochets are the same start a double crochet but instead of pull through 2, pull through 2, you start by pulling through all 3 at the start. A increase is when you put 2 single crochets in one stich. A decrease is when you take one loop from 2 stiches and complete a normal single crochet. This shrinks the amont of stiches. They are other stiches but these are the basic ones. </p>

<h3>Project Ideas</h3>
<p style = "color:rgb(229, 32, 147);> You can make lots of things with crochet, such as clothing, home decor, toys, and accessories. Earrings, hair clips, plush toys, sweaters, and coasters are a few of my favorites. </p>

<div style="background-color: plum;>
<h3>How to get started</h3>
<p style = "color:rgb(229, 32, 147);> You can start your project with chaining twice and going into the first chain and putting your stiches. You can also chain a certain amount and turn your project, and work in rows. Magic circles are also commmon, wrap your yarn around your fingers and make a cross, and flip your hand over. Take your hook and go under the first yarn. Pull up the second yarn through, and yarn over and pull through the second yarn. This should create a circle which you can put your stiches in. </p>

<h3>What is crochet?</h3>
<p style = "color:rgb(229, 32, 147);> Crochet is the process of taking yarn and creating it into a 3D structure. It turns loops into knots, and knots into fabric. It can be traced from many places such as Spain, Arabia, parts of the Mediterranean, China, and South America. Crocheting requires one hook but knitting needs two needles. </p>
