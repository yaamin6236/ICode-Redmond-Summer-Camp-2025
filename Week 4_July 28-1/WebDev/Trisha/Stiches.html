    <h1>Stiches</h1>
    <p>
       They are many stiches such as a single crochet, when you go into a stich and pull up a loop then yarn over and go through both loops. A double crochet is yarning over once and going into the stich, then pull up a loop and pull through 2, pull through 2. Half double crochets are the same start a double crochet but instead of pull through 2, pull through 2, you pull through all 3 at the same time. For a triple crochet, you yarn over twice, pull up a loop from the stich and pull through 2, pull through 2, pull through 2. Chains are made by having a slip knot, yarning over and pulling through. Slip stiches go into a stich, pull up a loop and take that loop through the other loop.  A increase is when you put 2 single crochets in one stich. A decrease is when you take one loop from 2 stiches yarn over pull through the top 2 then yarn over and pull through the last two. This shrinks the amount of stiches. They are many other stiches but these are the basic ones.

        If you want to learn more about these stiches, you can find many tutorials online or in crochet books. Practicing these basic stiches will help you create a variety of patterns and projects. I suggest following along with a video tutorial from <i>The Woobles</i>. They have great beginner-friendly videos that demonstrate these stiches step by step. Here is a link to their YouTube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheWoobles/videos">The Woobles.</a>
