    <h1>Where to Buy Yarn</h1>
    <p>
        The best places to buy yarn are craft stores such as <i>Michaels</i>, <i> The Knitters Studio</i>, and <i>Ben Franklin Crafts and Frames</i>. You can also buy yarn online like <i>Amazon</i>. Buying yarn online will not be as good as if you went to a store, so I recomend going in person. When buying yarn, make sure to check the thickness and type of yarn you need for your project. They are lots of yarn type to choose. The best for begainers is acrylic yarn, it is easy to see your stiches. Chenille yarn is harder to see your stiches but makes your projects fluffy and soft. Cotton yarn is good for clothing, it feels more comfortable then acrylic. Wool yarn is good for making hats and scarves. They are thousands of yarn to crochet with, so you can find the right yarn for you and your project.
