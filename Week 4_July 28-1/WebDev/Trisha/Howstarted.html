    <h1>How to Get Started</h1>
    <p>
       Before you get into crochet you should watch a video on how to hold your hook and yarn. Then you can start your project with chaining twice and going into the first chain and putting your stiches. This is a easier version of a magic circle. You can also chain a certain amount and turn your project, and work in rows. Magic circles are also commmon, wrap your yarn around your fingers and make a cross, and flip your hand over. Take your hook and go under the first yarn. Pull up the second yarn through, and yarn over and pull through the second yarn. This should create a circle which you can put your stiches in. Slip knots are also common, you can make a slip knot by making a loop with your yarn and pulling the second yarn through the first. You can then pull the yarn to tighten it around your hook.

    To help you get started, I suggest following along with a video from <i>The Woobles</i>. They have tutorials about how to start your project. Here is a link to their YouTube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheWoobles/videos">The Woobles.</a>
