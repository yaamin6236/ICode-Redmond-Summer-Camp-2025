    <h3>Mountains</h3>
    <p>Japan is a mountainous country, with about 70% of its land covered by mountain ranges that shape its geography, climate, and culture. These mountains are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, making them geologically active and home to many volcanoes. The most famous is Mount Fuji, an iconic and sacred peak that stands at 3,776 meters, making it the highest mountain in Japan. Other notable ranges include the Japanese Alps, which stretch across central Honshu and are divided into the Northern, Central, and Southern Alps. These mountains influence weather patterns, support rich biodiversity, and are popular destinations for hiking, skiing, and spiritual retreats. Historically, mountains have also played a role in shaping regional identities and protecting Japan from outside invasions.</p>

    <h3>Location</h3>
    <p>Japan is an island nation located in East Asia, situated in the Pacific Ocean to the east of the Korean Peninsula, China, and Russia. It is made up of over 6,800 islands, with the four largest—Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku—accounting for the vast majority of its land area and population. Japan lies along the Pacific Ring of Fire, a tectonically active region known for frequent earthquakes and numerous volcanoes. Its location also places it within a range of climates, from the snowy winters of northern Hokkaido to the subtropical warmth of Okinawa in the south. Surrounded by the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, and the Pacific Ocean, Japan's location has historically influenced its culture, economy, and interactions with neighboring countries, contributing to its strong maritime traditions and unique cultural development.</p>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p>Japan's geographic location offers several key benefits that have shaped its development, economy, and culture. Surrounded by the sea, Japan has access to abundant marine resources, making fishing a major industry and seafood a staple of its cuisine. Its position in the northwest Pacific also places it near major trade routes, facilitating economic relationships with powerful neighbors like China, South Korea, and the United States. The island nation’s natural barriers—the surrounding ocean and mountainous interior—have historically provided protection from invasions, allowing Japan to preserve its culture and political systems. Additionally, Japan's varied climate zones, from snowy mountains to subtropical islands, support diverse ecosystems and agricultural production, including rice, fruits, and tea. These geographical advantages have helped Japan become a technologically advanced, globally connected nation while maintaining a strong sense of identity.</p>

    <h3>Edo Period</h3>
    <p>Japan is a country with limited natural resources, which has significantly influenced its economic development and global trade strategies. It lacks large reserves of fossil fuels like oil, coal, and natural gas, making it heavily dependent on imports to meet its energy needs. However, Japan does possess some valuable resources, including forests that cover much of its mountainous terrain, providing timber, and coastal waters rich in marine life, which support a strong fishing industry. The country also has small deposits of minerals such as gold, silver, and copper, though they are not produced in large quantities. In response to its resource limitations, Japan has become a global leader in technology, innovation, and efficient manufacturing, importing raw materials and exporting high-value products. Its focus on renewable energy and recycling also reflects efforts to manage its limited natural resources sustainably.</p>
