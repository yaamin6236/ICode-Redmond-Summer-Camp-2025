    <h1>Major cities</h1>
    <p>Some of the major cities include Ho Chi Minh, Hanoi, Da Nang, and Can Tho.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Hanoi – The Capital City</h1>
    <p>Hanoi, located in northern Vietnam, is the country's capital and one of the oldest cities in Southeast Asia. With
        a rich history spanning over a thousand years, it's known for its centuries-old architecture, historical
        temples, and French colonial buildings. The city's cultural heart lies in the Old Quarter, a maze of narrow
        streets filled with street food, local markets, and traditional shops. Hanoi is also home to significant
        landmarks like the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, One Pillar Pagoda, and Hoan Kiem Lake. The city has a more
        traditional, slower-paced vibe compared to its southern counterpart.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) – The Economic Hub</h1>
    <p>Formerly known as Saigon, Ho Chi Minh City is the largest city in Vietnam and serves as the country’s economic
        engine. Located in the south, it’s a bustling metropolis with a dynamic blend of modern skyscrapers, historic
        French colonial buildings, and vibrant street life. District 1 is the commercial and cultural center, home to
        landmarks like the Notre-Dame Cathedral, Ben Thanh Market, and War Remnants Museum. HCMC is known for its fast
        pace, thriving business environment, and vibrant nightlife, making it a magnet for young professionals and
        tourists alike.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Da Nang – The Coastal Gateway</h1>
    <p>Da Nang, located in central Vietnam, is a rapidly developing coastal city known for its clean beaches, modern
        infrastructure, and laid-back lifestyle. It serves as a gateway to famous UNESCO World Heritage Sites like Hoi
        An, My Son Sanctuary, and the Imperial City of Hue. The city itself features attractions like the Dragon Bridge,
        Marble Mountains, and Ba Na Hills (home to the iconic Golden Bridge held by giant hands). Da Nang strikes a
        balance between urban living and natural beauty, with a growing reputation as a livable city.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Can Tho – The Heart of the Mekong Delta</h1>
    <p>Can Tho is the largest city in the Mekong Delta, located in southern Vietnam. Known for its floating markets
        (especially Cai Rang), lush canals, and fertile farmland, the city plays a crucial role in Vietnam’s
        agricultural output. Life here is slower and deeply tied to the rhythms of the river. Can Tho offers a more
        relaxed, authentic experience of delta culture with attractions like the Binh Thuy Ancient House, Ninh Kieu
        Wharf, and various river cruises through rural villages and mangrove forests.</p>
