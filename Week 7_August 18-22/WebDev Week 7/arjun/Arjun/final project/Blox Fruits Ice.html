                Ice Fruit (Hie Hie no Mi)

Type: Elemental Fruit
Rarity: Very Rare / Legendary
Price: Usually expensive, depending on the server and trading market
Obtained: Found randomly from Blox Fruit spawns every hour or bought/traded with other players

Powers and Abilities:

Eating the Ice Fruit gives the user ice-based powers, allowing them to freeze enemies and control ice in battle. It’s great for crowd control and dealing consistent damage.

Main Abilities:

Ice Wave – Sends out a wave of ice that damages and can freeze opponents.

Ice Pillar – Creates pillars of ice to attack or block.

Ice Slide – Allows fast movement by sliding on ice.

Ice Prison – Traps enemies in blocks of ice, immobilizing them temporarily.

Advantages:

Can freeze opponents, making it easier to land combos.

Good for both PvP and PvE.

Strong crowd control with freezing effects.

Decent range attacks.

Weaknesses:

Ice attacks are weaker against Fire-type fruits (like Flame Fruit).

Some abilities have cooldowns that need timing.

Requires skill to master timing and positioning.
