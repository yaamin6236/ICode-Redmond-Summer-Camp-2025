      <p class="blue">
        lionel messi was born on june 24 1987 in argentina. At 17 Messi made his
        competitve debut for Barcelona in october 2004. He gradually established
        himself as an integral player for the club, and during his first
        uninterrupted season at age 22 in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve
        the first treble in Spanish football. This resulted in Messi winning the
        first of four consecutive Ballon d'Ors, and by the 2011–12 season he set
        the European record for most goals in a season and established himself
        as Barcelona's all-time top scorer.

      <b id="bold">Time with Argentina </b>
      <p class="blue">
        At 17, he was two years younger than the other players and, at around
        half their height, he looked even younger. With his floppy hair and
        boyish air he did not cut an impressive figure. It was impossible to
        imagine him as a future superstar -- until he got on the ball and all of
        us suffered a collective jaw drop. The way the ball was tied to his left
        foot was enough to make sure that everyone was paying attention. But
        there was so much more -- his awareness of what was happening around
        him, the calm of his decision making, the clear impression that none of
        this talent was wasted, that it was all employed in creating a threat to
        the opposing goal. It did not take long before our secret was out. A few
        months later he was the star as Argentina won the Under-20 World Cup.
