        <p>That hour of morning games was the perfect kickoff to our first day—thank you so much for bringing the energy and fun! You created an atmosphere that helped everyone loosen up, laugh, and connect, which made the start of this experience feel welcoming and exciting. Whether it was teamwork, friendly competition, or just pure silliness, that hour set a tone we’ll remember. We truly appreciated your effort and spirit—it was the kind of thoughtful gesture that made all the difference</p>
