            <h2>1. What is Badminton?</h2>
            <p>
                <a>Badminton is an indoor raquet sport played by either two opposing players or two teams of doubles.
                    Each
                    player has a wired racket and try to hit a shuttle over a seperation net to gain points. To win, a
                    player or
                    team must secure over half of the number of games, by reaching the number of points set for the
                    individual
                    game. In professional games, a player or team needs to secure 2 out of 3 games by reaching 21 with a
                    2
                    point
                    lead. If that is not achieved than the first player to 30 points wins the round, and if it is the
                    second
                    won
                    game then the entire game.

            <h2>2. History</h2>
            <p>
                <a>
                    Badminton is derived directly from the game “poona,” which was played by British army officers
                    stationed
                    in India in the 1860s. The Bath Badminton Club was established in Bath, England, in 1877 and
                    introduced
                    new rules to the game. The formation of the Badminton Association of England (BAE) in 1893 marked a
                    significant step in standardizing the rules and regulations of the sport. The first All England Open
                    Badminton Championships, considered the world’s first badminton tournament, were held in 1899. These
                    developments laid the foundation for badminton’s global expansion.
